# Processes of Making NoResume

In this document, I'll be making some notes on how I have developed this application for 
future overview of managing relevant processes.

## Procedure

+ Firstly, I've created the project using a command. The command is:
    - ``` $ dotnet new mvc -o NoResume ```
+ Then I have created two markdown files, named as Making.md and README.md
+ I have added materialize css to the design library
